            <p class="teaser">
    <html><body>Last time in the eventflow series we’ve seen how to define a bit more complex example. However, the example, while being functionally correct, has started to show that systems can still seem more complex than they should be. This time, we’ll see a new addition to the eventflow - a custom DSL, that makes defining an aggregate a breeze! The <a href="./posts/eventflow-just-got-even-prettier/">… read more</a>

    <html><body>Last time we’ve seen an example of a simple aggregate defined as an <em>Eventflow</em>. We’ve created a simple counter, that can be incremented and decremented, but it cannot be decremented below zero. All it needed was a local state for the counter value and an ability to fail a command.

            <p class="teaser">
    <html><body> Why? One of the main features of Scala are implicits. They add the power to create type classes in a similar way to Haskell. However, as much as they are useful, they are also somewhat complex to grok. When is an implicit passed? What if there are a few matches available? Where does scala look for them?

            <p class="teaser">
    <html><body> Modelling an aggregate An aggregate in a DDD system defines a consistency boundary for the entities it describes. Usually, this is implemented as a set of entities, where one of them is denoted as the aggregate root. To the outside world, this aggregate root is more or less a black box. No entity below the aggregate root can be <a href="./posts/eventflow-cqrs-es-in-scala/">… read more</a>

            <p class="teaser">
    <html><body> Where are we now? Last time we’ve looked at implementing a CQRS/ES application in Haskell - a purely functional programming language. This gave us some insights of how we can compose the elements together. Today we’re going to look at some existing CQRS/ES examples in Scala.

            <p class="teaser">
    <html><body> What is it all about? CQRS is not a new architectural pattern. And it is used more and more in complex applications, that require a highly scalable infrastructure. The main principle of CQRS is based on CQS - the Command Query Separation principle. It states that a method in object oriented paradigm must by either a command or a <a href="./posts/cqrs-es-in-haskell/">… read more</a>
