# Where are we now?

[Last time](/posts/cqrs-es-in-haskell/) we've looked at implementing a CQRS/ES application in Haskell - a purely functional programming language. This gave us some insights of how we can compose the elements together and we'll use this knowledge today. Today we're going to look at some CQRS/ES implementations in Scala.
